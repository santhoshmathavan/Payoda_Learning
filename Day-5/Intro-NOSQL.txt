CAP Theorem
	It states that is impossible for a distributed data store to offer more than two out of three guarantees
	
	->Consistency
	->Availability
	->Partition Tolerance

MongoDB
	->MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the   cloud
	->As a programmer, you think in objects.
	->Community,Enterprise
	->Rich JSON Documents
	->Documents->collections->Database
	->Written in C++
	->Classified as a NoSQL database program
	->Uses JSON like documents
	->Current Stable Release : 4.4.3
	->Editions- 1)Community
				2)Enterprise
				3)Mongodb ATlas
	->Developed in early 2007 when the company was developing a an azure like platform
	->  Company name was *10gen* after named it as MongoDB Inc
	->In year 2010 March it was released as a ready product and an opensourse database server to all maintained by the organisation itself

	*)  Schema less
	*)  No complex joins
	*)  Scalability
	*)  Uses Internal Memory
	
postgressql
	->13.1  2 months ago
	->1996
	->open source relational database that supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.
	->highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years of community development
	->procedural language PL/pgSQL

Graph Database
	->Graph databases are purpose-built to store and navigate relationships. 
	->Relationships are first-class citizens in graph databases, and most of the value of graph databases is derived from 	    these relationships. 
	->Graph databases use nodes to store data entities, and edges to store relationships between entities. An edge always has a start node, end node, type, and direction, and an edge can describe parent-child relationships, actions, ownership, and the like. 
	->There is no limit to the number and kind of relationships a node can have.
	->AWS->Neptune
	
Neo4j
	->Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database
	->The source code, written in Java and Scala,
	->Neo4j has both a Community Edition and Enterprise Edition of the database.
	->Neo4j is referred to as a native graph database because it efficiently implements the property graph model down to the storage level. 
	->Cypher, a declarative query language similar to SQL, but optimized for graphs. Now used by other databases like SAP HANA Graph and Redis graph

Azure Cosmos DB
	->Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development.
	->Complete service and ready to use.
	->Multi-API(SQL,Cassandra)
	->A number of consistency levels
	->Latency: Very low latency is practically guaranteed at less than 10 milliseconds when reading data and less than 15 milliseconds when writing data.

Cassandra
	-> Written in Java
	-> Facebook - Avinash Lakshman(Amazon Dynamo), Prashant Malik.
              Inbox feauture.
	->July 2008 
	->Apache incubator- 2009.
	->Feb 2010 - Top level project
	->Version - 3.2.1
	->Distributed NoSQl database "Column Based".
	->Keyspaces and column family.
	->column(key,value)->group of columns->Rows(Identified by Row keys)->list of Row keys form columns family->list of columns forms a Key Space
	->Query language - CQL (cassandra query language)
	->Every node has a replica, so nodata is ever lost

Redis
	->Redis is a NoSQL database which follows the principle of key-value store. 
	->Redis is an apt solution for building highperformance, scalable web applications.
	->It is often referred to as a data structure server, since the keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.
